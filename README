# REMEMBER YOU NEED autoconf-archive (from nongnu stuff)

on ubuntu:

$ apt-get install autoconf-archive

due to phtread stuff

if you can't fine autoconf-archive in your gnu/linux distribution i've just add a copy
of "acx_pthread.m4" macro in stuff dir.. so copy this file into m4 dir and run:

$  aclocal --force -I m4

if you are experiencing some other trouble try rerunning ./bootstrap
